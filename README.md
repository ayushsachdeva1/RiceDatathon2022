# Cognite Rice Datathon 2022 Challenge

We have created multiple programs in Python and R which allows us to visualize the wind speed and wind direction in a time series plot. 

## Different Files
- driver.py: This is our main python file which creates two important visualizations. First, we are visualizing wind speed and wind direction in a time series plot for each of three windstations. For our second plot, we are creating a polar plot for the average wind direction and wind speeds for each day across the three windstations (if data is available). 

- datathon.rmd: This is our main R file which creates two important visualizations. This allows us to understand the problem from a mutli-visual perspective in multiple programs. This is integral to our project because different interactive dashboards can use different programming languages. First, we are visualizing wind speed and wind direction in a time series plot for each of three windstations. For our second plot, we are creating a polar plot for the average wind direction and wind speeds for each day across the three windstations (if data is available). 


## Running the files

- driver.py: Run the following command on terminal "python3 driver.py" and you will see the the time series plot with the polar plot. 
- datathon.rmd: Simply press run on RStudio.
